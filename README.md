This project was designed to give users the ability to gather a 5-day weather forecast based off of a search by city.

Functionality includes:
- leveraging the OpenWeather third party API
- allowing the user to interact with the search bar and type in their desired city
- saving the search history to local storage
- clearing search history using the 'clear history' button
